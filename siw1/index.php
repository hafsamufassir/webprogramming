				<h1>What is 3D Resin Painting and Resin Art?</h1>
				<img src="assets/index.jpg">
				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">3D resin painting is a new form of medium to create three-dimensional artworks. Artists, designers and technicians are exploring resin as a material for several uses. This detailed blog will let you jump deeper in the concept of 3D resin painting or 3D resin art. Before we move further, let us know about this substance called resin!</p>


				<h1>What is resin?</h1>

				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">Epoxy resins are a two-component system consisting of resin and hardener. By mixing the two components, a chemical reaction takes place so that the liquid resin gradually hardens to a solid plastic.
				The result is a high-gloss, clear surface. For the sake of simplicity, I will usually use the term “resin” instead of “epoxy resin”. Resin is not only used in industry and boat building, but also in art. Thus, besides kitchen counters, floors, tables, pictures, jewellery or sculptures can also be cast.</p>

				<h1>Application of Resin in Art</h1>
				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">The trend to use resin in art comes from the USA, Canada and Australia. In Europe, the technology is still little known. With resin you can create works of art that enchant with their clarity, luminosity, brilliance and depth. Color pigments or other additives are added to the resin. Different effects can be created by choosing the painting ground, the type of casting, the colours and the additives. Even experienced resin artists have never finished learning.
				If you like experimenting, you will love working with resin. Resin can also be used to finish drawings, photos and pictures (made of oil, acrylic, alcohol ink, watercolour, ink, mixed media, etc.) with a shine that can be created and also to protect them from UV light and mechanical influences. You can also use epoxy on wood, build your own epoxy river table or creat your own geode art with it.</p>
				
				<h1>What is 3D Resin Painting?</h1>
				<img src="assets/resin_index.jpg">
				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">The term 3D resign painting is quite confusing! How can a painting be three dimensional? How does resin make a 3D painting? Will it deliver the same effects as a three-dimensional sculpture? How big will the artwork be? There are several doubts, which immediately crop up. These queries will solely meet positive answers.

				Yes, 3D resin painting is three dimensional because it uses a flat surface and layers up to create an exceptionally beautiful painting with the three-dimensional feature. There is no such limitation in the size of an artwork. Artists have made wall hangings, free-standing and independents resin artwork, which can be a part of your collection.</p>

				<h1>What materials are needed for 3D Resin painting?</h1>
				<img src="assets/resin_index2.jpg">
				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">There are specific constant materials required for the 3D painting with resin, which cannot be avoided in any case. These resin art supplies should be bought from the trusted source.</p>
				<h3>Solid Base</h3>
				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">The most suitable bases for the resin paints are wood, plexiglass, concrete, glass, and other bases, which have the capacity to hold the weight. Resin art cannot be executed on porous and absorbent bases. Avoid using canvas for resin paintings, because the fabric cannot manage the pressure, and the fabric will absorb liquid, sagging the whole artwork. With a myriad of textured containers, you can explore the resin art on floors, tables, commodities, and other accessories.</p>
				<h3>Liquid pigments or Powdered Mica pigments</h3>
				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">The outcome of the resin painting depends on the quality of the pigments you utilize. There are two types of pigments: Powder and liquid. Both are equally suitable and deliver amazing results. Do not forget to test them before initiating the work of 3D resin artwork.</p>



				<h1>Customization at Serene Art Life studio</h1>

				<p style="line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px;">Experiencing tremendous response to the goldfish 3D resin paintings, Serene Art Life studio and Lillian Lee artist has begun exploring customized products like accessories, show-pieces, resin ornaments, and many more for the valuable customers. Serene Art Life studio artists will provide complimentary sketches of designs after a detailed meeting with the customer.

We decide the price of your artwork, depending on the number of goldfishes, size, the material of the container, the style of the subject, and other essential elements.</p>
