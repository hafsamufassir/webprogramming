				<h1>What is resin?</h1>
				<img src="img1.jpg">
				
				<p>Epoxy resins are a two-component system consisting of resin and hardener. By mixing the two components, a chemical reaction takes place so that the liquid resin gradually hardens to a solid plastic.
				The result is a high-gloss, clear surface. For the sake of simplicity, I will usually use the term “resin” instead of “epoxy resin”. Resin is not only used in industry and boat building, but also in art. Thus, besides kitchen counters, floors, tables, pictures, jewellery or sculptures can also be cast.</p>

				<h1>Application of Resin in Art</h1>
				<p>The trend to use resin in art comes from the USA, Canada and Australia. In Europe, the technology is still little known. With resin you can create works of art that enchant with their clarity, luminosity, brilliance and depth. Color pigments or other additives are added to the resin. Different effects can be created by choosing the painting ground, the type of casting, the colours and the additives. Even experienced resin artists have never finished learning.
				If you like experimenting, you will love working with resin. Resin can also be used to finish drawings, photos and pictures (made of oil, acrylic, alcohol ink, watercolour, ink, mixed media, etc.) with a shine that can be created and also to protect them from UV light and mechanical influences. You can also use epoxy on wood, build your own epoxy river table or creat your own geode art with it.</p>
